## 1. One idea per unit (paragraph atomicity)

**Source:** Cognitive Load Theory, Chunking

I never introduce more than **one new concept per paragraph**.

* Paragraphs are semantic atoms
* If an idea needs a “however” or “also”, it probably needs a new paragraph
* This prevents working-memory overload

This mirrors how books and good documentation are written.

---

## 2. Short paragraphs with intentional breaks

**Source:** Eye-movement theory, Reading ergonomics

Most paragraphs are **2–4 lines max**.

* White space acts as punctuation
* Breaks signal completion of a thought
* The reader never feels “trapped” in a block

This reduces both visual and cognitive fatigue.

---

## 3. Strong signaling before detail

**Source:** Information foraging theory

I tell you *what you’re about to read* before you read it.

* Section titles state conclusions, not topics
* Bold phrases anchor scanning
* Lists preview structure

This lets readers skim safely without losing meaning.

---

## 4. Progressive commitment in text

**Source:** Progressive disclosure, pedagogical writing

I start with:

* The core idea
* Then elaboration
* Then examples or nuance

You can stop reading at any layer and still walk away with value.

---

## 5. Vertical rhythm as a first-class concern

**Source:** Typographic rhythm, book design

I consciously manage:

* Paragraph spacing
* List spacing
* Section spacing

There is a predictable cadence:

> statement → pause → explanation → pause

This creates flow without conscious effort.

---

## 6. Redundancy without repetition

**Source:** Learning science

Key ideas are:

* Restated in different words
* Reframed from different angles
* Summarized structurally

This reinforces understanding without feeling repetitive.

---

## 7. Lists are used for structure, not decoration

**Source:** Chunking, Gestalt proximity

Lists appear only when:

* Items are conceptually parallel
* The reader benefits from comparison
* Order or grouping matters

I avoid long, undifferentiated lists.

---

## 8. Headings carry meaning, not labels

**Source:** Information hierarchy

Bad heading:

> “Typography”

Good heading:

> “Typography should disappear during reading”

Headings act as summaries, not categories.

---

## 9. Predictable sentence structure

**Source:** Processing fluency

I prefer:

* Active voice
* Familiar grammatical patterns
* Limited nesting

This reduces parsing effort and increases comprehension speed.

---

## 10. Removal over addition

**Source:** Signal-to-noise, negative capability

I actively remove:

* Decorative language
* Clever phrasing
* Unnecessary metaphors

Clarity beats personality when the goal is understanding.

---

## 11. Visual hierarchy even in plain text

**Source:** Gestalt principles

Even without styling, I rely on:

* Line breaks
* Indentation
* Ordering
* Emphasis markers

The eye should know where to go next.

---

## 12. Write for scanning first, reading second

**Source:** Web reading behavior (Nielsen)

I assume the reader will:

1. Scan
2. Sample
3. Commit

So the structure must survive scanning intact.

`code`

```
x = 42;
console.log(`The answer is ${x}`);
